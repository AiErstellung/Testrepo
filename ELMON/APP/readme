# Elmon Video Reviewer

A private, local Android app for two reviewers to stream S3-hosted videos in a vertical swipe feed and record why they rejected a clip.

## Key Features
- Jetpack Compose UI with a TikTok-style vertical pager.
- ExoPlayer (Media3) stream playback from IONOS Object Storage.
- Room database keeps track of like/dislike decisions per video (feedback is stored too).
- Videos already rated are removed from the feed and never shown again in the same session.
- Disliking a video opens a short comment dialog; the text is written to `bad/feedback/<videoId>.json` for later exports.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Define your IONOS Object Storage settings in `ELMON/APP/local.properties` (that file is local-only and must not hold credentials in Git). Add:
   ```
   ELMON_STORAGE_ENDPOINT=https://s3.eu-central-3.ionoscloud.com
   ELMON_STORAGE_BUCKET=buckybucket
   ELMON_STORAGE_REGION=eu-central-3
   ELMON_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   ELMON_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```
3. Upload `pending/videos.json` to `pending/videos.json` inside the bucket. Each entry should contain `id`, `title`, `url` (preferably the public S3 URL) and, if the link does not start with `https://<endpoint>/<bucket>/`, include an `s3Key` field with the object path so the app can move it later.
4. Build & install via `./gradlew installDebug` or run directly from Android Studio.

## Storage workflow
- The app always downloads `pending/videos.json` from the bucket and renders only that list.
- When you like a video, the app copies the object from `pending/` to `good/` and removes it from the original folder.
- When you dislike a video, a dialog appears to collect a short comment. The app copies the object into `bad/`, deletes it from `pending/`, and writes your text to `bad/feedback/<videoId>.json`.
- Keep `pending/videos.json` in sync with the bucket (remove entries after they move) so the feed never re-shows already-reviewed clips.
