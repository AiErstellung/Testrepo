# Elmon Video Reviewer

A private, local Android app for two reviewers to stream GitHub-hosted videos in a vertical swipe feed and rate them without any backend.

## Key Features
- Jetpack Compose UI with a TikTok-style vertical pager.
- ExoPlayer (Media3) stream playback from raw GitHub URLs.
- Room database keeps track of like/dislike decisions per video.
- Videos already rated are removed from the feed and never shown again in the same session.
- Ratings are persisted locally (one row per video) to support later JSON/CSV exports.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Update the VIDEOS_JSON_URL field in pp/build.gradle.kts so it points to your repository's /pending/videos.json (raw.githubusercontent.com).
3. Build & install via ./gradlew installDebug or run directly from Android Studio.

## Workflow
- The app fetches ideos.json from /pending/ and only shows videos from that folder.
- Liking/disliking a video writes a VideoRating to Room and prevents that video from appearing again.
- After local review, manually move videos in the GitHub repo from /pending/ to /liked/ or /rejected/ and update ideos.json.
- Exporting rated videos (JSON/CSV) will be added later; the Room table already supports that flow.
